The faint smell of damp earth and the chill of stagnant air waft through the narrow opening, hinting at a long-forgotten route to the outside world.\n\nThe passageway appears to snake its way beyond the tavern's walls, its shadows offering the promise of secrecy and safety. Should the night's feeding take a turn for the worse, this escape route could mean the difference between life and death.
